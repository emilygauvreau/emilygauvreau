ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @emilygauvreau I'm currently in my fourth year of the Biomedical Computing Specialization at Queen's University in Kingstion, Ontario

Right now I am currently on a 16 month internship with the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps team at IBM. I will be wrapping that opportunity up at the end of August 2021.

ðŸ‘€ In term of the biomedical portion of my degree Iâ€™m interested in the human genome and medical imaging. On the computing side of things I am interested in DevOps and CI/CD development and hope to continue working with those topics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop my own webpage, I hope to have it up and running for your review soon.

ðŸ“« You can reach me at emily.gauvreau@queensu.ca or on my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/emilygauvreau) I'd love to connect!
